 NOTES:
 The MTA labels the S shuttle as the 'GS' route, so the S shuttle icon has been named 'GS.png'
 The MTA labels some express 6 trains as having the route '6X' but does not distinguish any other local/express
 with separate routes. Thus, the app treats any query for the 6 train as both a query for the 6 and 6X trains.
